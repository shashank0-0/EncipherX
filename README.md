🔹 2. Clone This Repository

Run the following command in your terminal (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows):

git clone https://github.com/shashank0-0/text_encryptor.git
cd text_encryptor


---

🔹 3. Build the Project

Run the following command to compile the program:

cargo build --release

This creates an optimized executable in target/release/.


---

🔹 4. Run the Program

For Linux/macOS:

./target/release/text_encryptor

For Windows (CMD/PowerShell):

target\release\text_encryptor.exe


---

🔑 Usage

When you run the program, you'll see a menu like this:

Choose an option:
1. Encrypt text
2. Decrypt text
3. Exit

Encryption

1. Enter the text to encrypt


2. Enter a password


3. The encrypted text will be displayed and saved in encrypted.txt



Example:

Enter text to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter a password: ******
Encrypted text: bXlxzFVsUV... (Base64 output)
Encrypted data saved to encrypted.txt

Decryption

1. Enter the encrypted text manually or from encrypted.txt


2. Enter the correct password


3. The decrypted text will be displayed



Example:

Enter a password: ******
Decrypted text: Hello, World!

📦 Cross-Compiling for Windows (From Linux)

If you want to build a Windows .exe file from Linux, install the Windows target:

rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

The Windows .exe file will be generated at:

target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/text_encryptor.exe
